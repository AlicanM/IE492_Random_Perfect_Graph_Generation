	abstract = {In this paper we introduce a new graph composition, called 2-amalgam, and we prove that the 2-amalgam of perfect graphs is perfect. This composition generalizes many of the operations known to preserve perfection, such as the clique identification, substitution, join and amalgam operations. We give polynominal-time algorithms to determined whether a general graph is decomposable with respect to the 2-amalgam or amalgam operations.}}

	abstract = {We show that the recognition problem of a Meyniel graph is polynomial by presenting a polynomial recognition algorithm. The Meyniel graphs are the graphs in which every odd elementary cycle (≥ 5) has at least two chords. These graphs are known to be perfect. As a by-product we obtain new results concerning some classes contained in Meyniel graphs: triangulated graphs, o-triangulated graphs and parity graphs.}}
